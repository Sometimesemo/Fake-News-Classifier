## Description

This project uses machine learning to classify news articles into fake news and real news. It is based on text data from a dataset that forms the basis for training a classification model.

## Usage

To use the model and make predictions, you can follow the provided instructions in the Jupyter Notebook or in your Python environment. The model can be used to classify text data and determine whether it is fake news or real news.

## Data

The data for this project is not included in the repository as it may be subject to copyright (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ruchi798/how-do-you-recognize-fake-news/input).
However, you can use your own data to train the model and make predictions. Ensure that your data is in the same format as the dataset used in the notebook.

## Preparation

The Jupyter Notebook provides detailed information on data preparation, cleaning, and transformation of text data into a format suitable for the model. All steps are thoroughly documented in the notebook.

## Model Training

The model is trained in the notebook using various machine learning algorithms. You can select the best parameters for the models and train the model on your own data.

## Evaluation

The model is extensively evaluated, including accuracy, recall, and other performance metrics. The results are documented in the notebook.
